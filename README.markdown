Here be config files...
-----------------------

They're from my macbook, but I share them with some linux machines too. Please use anything you'd like. I put them here for my own benefit, but if you want to use them and have questions I'm happy to help.

### NeoVim

Uses [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

1. `pip3 install neovim neovim-remote`
2. Copy `.nvimrc` and `.nvim` to `$HOME`
3. Run `:PlugInstall` inside NeoVim
